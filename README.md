Project page for the simple keybinding scheme Wakib. 

## Project Goals

The project was born from an attempt to come up with a keybindings scheme for cursor movement to replicate much of what Vim and Emacs bindings do but in a simpler manner. Initially this started off as an Emacs extension, but slowly grew to cover more programs. This is now a project to enable the use of these keybindings everywhere possible.

## Project Basics

The basic keybindings are shown below. These deal mainly with cursor movement and deleting, and so can be used with just about any program.
